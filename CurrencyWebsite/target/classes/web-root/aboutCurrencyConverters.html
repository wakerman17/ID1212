	<h1>About Currency Converters</h1>
	<p>A currency converter is software code that is designed to convert one currency into another in order to check its corresponding 
	value. The code is generally a part of a web site or it forms a mobile app and it is based on current market or bank exchange rates.</p>
	<p>In order to convert one currency into another, a user enters an amount of money (e.g. '1000') and chooses the currency he/she 
	wishes to check the monetary value of (e.g. 'United States Dollar'). After that, the user selects one, or sometimes several other 
	currencies, he/she would like to see the result in. The application software then calculates and displays the corresponding amount of money.</p>
	<p>Currency converters aim to maintain real-time information on current market or bank exchange rates, so that the calculated result 
	changes whenever the value of either of the component currencies does. They do so by connecting to a database of current currency 
	exchange rates. The frequency at which currency converters update the exchange rates they use varies: Yahoo currency converter 
	updates its rates every day, while Convert My Money< every hour.</p>
